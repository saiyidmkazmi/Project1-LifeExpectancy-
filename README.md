**Life Expectancy vs General Conditions**

**Project Description/Outline: **
In our project, we used extensive research on life expectancy across the globe over time and found correlations between these values with other factors that pertain to general quality of life and conditions such as access to water, handwashing, etc.

**Research Questions to Answer:**
1. How does access to water effect life expectancy?
2. How does hand washing habits effect life expectancy?
3. Is there a correlation between lack of water access and increased rates of pollution?
4. How does pollution effect life expectancy?
5. How does basic sanitation services effect overall life expectancy?
6. How does the number of Doctors effect the overall life expectancy?
7. How does the number of Pharmacist effect the overall life expectancy?

**Datasets to be Used:**

**Rough Breakdown of Task:**
As a group of data analysts, we are finding the key factors that affect overall life expectancy around the globe in order to use the trends we see to increase life expectancy. Weâ€™ll accomplish this by a series of visualizations and data analysis providing insight to our questions.

**Delegation of Tasks**

Samual C:
Data Cleaning, General Coding, & Major Findings
> Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)
> Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process

Debra P:
Visualization and Major Findings
> Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis
> Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)
> Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentations

Visualization, Major Findings, & Presentation
> Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)
> Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation
> Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.


*Optional*
Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions
